Lets check if we can compile the welcome.c program using the gnu c compiler.
I'm assuming it comes with wsl...

Fix the errors, mainly getlogin() is an int but str has char substitute. 
Also need to add the unistd to address the implicit func def for getlogin.

I have swapped getlogin with getpwnam() and added an run argument for username,
we also import the pwd.h for the passwd struct.
